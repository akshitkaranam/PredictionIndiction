## Introduction and Dataset

*Introduction*

PredictionIndiction is a restaurant recommendation system that goes beyond the usual notion of using attributes, such as cuisine and rating, to generate recommendation solely based on the restaurants the user has visited. Instead, PredictionIndiction also takes into account the restaurants his friends have visited.

Recent research has shown that friends may be similar due to peer influence or diffusion: the tendency for characteristics and behaviors to spread through social ties such that friends increasingly resemble one another over time (Centola D ,2010). So, the underlying assumption of this recommender is that friends have similar tastes.

*Our Identity*

Prediction: a thing predicted; a forecast

Indiction: a valuation of property made every 15 years as a basis for taxation.

The name of our recommender exemplifies our aim to give precise and valuable predictions for users.
